The module is intended to provide a solid overview of the extensive range of structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry software and its use:
* Identify which of the software packages provide good results and are cost effective.
* Using the commercial software Agisoft Metashape, an optimized workflow for orthoimage generation will be demonstrated and practiced.
* Optionally, this workflow is also explained and illustrated with the open source software OpenDroneMap. 
* Optional tutorials are available for special tasks.
