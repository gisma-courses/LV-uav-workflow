This introduction is intended to serve three main purposes: 

* To get a first overview of the research approaches and projects in the broadest sense of applied environmental science. 
* To integrate the reading and reception of primary literature, i.e. studies, reviews and other compilations, into the research process.
* To learn to compare the evaluation of what has been read with one's own assessment and thus to create the basis for valid procedures.
