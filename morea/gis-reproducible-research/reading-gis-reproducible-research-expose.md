published: true
morea_id: experience-gis-reproducible-research-expose
morea_summary: "For the scientific practice it is proven to document and communicate the chosen approach in a transpa-
rent and comprehensible way. Since the development and execution of a scientific work is a creative
achievement, i.e. not a stringent, but rather an iterative process, the work usually does not proceed in
such a linear and consistent manner as the final formulated version would suggest."
