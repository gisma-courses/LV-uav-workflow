# Blogging portals for project reports and more

#### GitHub related

My favorites are on github for various reasons.
* free of charge
* version control
* automated workflows
* deep integration with all types of IT related work

There are numerous approaches and all of them are interesting:

* One of the best because you just can integrate your Word `.docx` documents is [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages). The setup is a bit of tinkering but excellently described after that it [works](https://gisma-courses.github.io/gisma-pages/) like a charm. 
* An `R`-focused workflow is provided  by blogdown and Hugo. Follow the instructions of [Academic writing made easy](https://gisma-courses.github.io/gi-modules/post/2021-11-16-making-of-academic-websites/) be followed. It is great for automated documentation with R a bit bulky for *"simple"* blogging pages.
* A very straightforward way is using the [fast-template](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/) package. 

#### Non Github related

If you are not familiar with GitHub, you can find a variety of "free" blogging portals that you can easily use. Many of them come with ads in the free version.  The following links to popular providers represent a good selection. Simply create any kind of account for registration  account and off you go...

* [hpage](https://de.hpage.com/) (hosted in Germany according to the General Data Protection Regulation)
* [wix](https://www.wix.com/) fancy, very easy to use but with commercial advertising in the free version
* [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) fancy, medium easy 
* [blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) Google ecosystem easy to use, high integration with Google see also [Larry Ludwigs Review](https://larryludwig.com/blogger-review/)

All of this suggestions are providing you free web space and a wide reach for those who are interested. And of course there are much more really cool possibilities
