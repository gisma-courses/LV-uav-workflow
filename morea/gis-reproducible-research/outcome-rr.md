The importance of reproducible research is rooted in the self-commitment to good scientific practice and rests on the foundation of transparent and repeatable research work. No matter what type of documentation is used, including websites, blogs, or gray literature, it must meet these criteria.
This module is by no means stepmotherly on the sidelines but very central for scientific work and the communication of results:
* It provides an overview of adequate reproducible work and documentation strategies. 
* It provides the skills to independently create complex web pages and online presentations
