## Welcome to Micro Remote Sensing 


The Micro Remote Sensing course - provides a complete introduction to reproducible flight planning, acquisition, pre-processing, and exemplar analysis of high resolution low cost image data using commercial and open software systems. 

## Who should take this course?

This course is designed for students of all levels who have a basic knowledge of the organization of their operating system. Programming knowledge is not required but will be helpful for the advanced module *Analysis of high resolution aerial data*. The focus is on a practical approach to the independent acquisition of high resolution aerial data. Post-processing of products and an introduction to classification and analysis of the generated data sets complete the course.

## Didactic Concept

 The course is structured as a sequential but *not* necessarily linear sequence of [modules](/LV-uav-workflow/modules) to be worked through, each lasting approximately 3 weeks. Each module has the following structure:


  * [Outcomes](/LV-uav-workflow/outcomes) - what is the learning objective.
  * [Readings](/LV-uav-workflow/readings) - all kind of reading resources.
  * [Experiences](/LV-uav-workflow/experiences) - exercises & tutorials to practically master the learning goals.
  * [Assessments](/LV-uav-workflow/assessments) - self assessment to get an idea how you perform.
  
The `labels` are intended to provide a quick overview of the content and meaning of the individual units within a module. The `mandatory` units are the minimum requirements for the course. The other resources are mainly used for internal differentiation in case of higher interest and as a starting point for independent deepening.
