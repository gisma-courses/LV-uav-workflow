## Welcome to Micro Remote Sensing

The *Micro Remote Sensing* course offers a comprehensive introduction to reproducible flight planning, data acquisition, pre-processing, and example-based analysis of high-resolution, low-cost image data — using both commercial and open-source software tools.

---

## Who Should Take This Course?

This course is intended for learners of all levels who possess a basic understanding of their operating system's structure. While programming knowledge is **not required**, it may be helpful — especially for the advanced module *Analysis of High-Resolution Aerial Data*.

The main focus is on the **practical acquisition** of high-resolution aerial imagery. The course is rounded off with post-processing workflows and an introduction to classification and analysis of the generated datasets.

## Didactic Concept

The course consists of a sequential (but not strictly linear) set of [modules](/LV-uav-workflow/modules), each designed to be completed in approximately **three weeks**.

Each module follows this structure:

- [Outcomes](/LV-uav-workflow/outcomes): Learning objectives  
- [Readings](/LV-uav-workflow/readings): Core and supplemental resources  
- [Experiences](/LV-uav-workflow/experiences): Exercises and tutorials for hands-on learning  
- [Assessments](/LV-uav-workflow/assessments): Self-assessment to monitor progress  

The `labels` provide a quick overview of the content and importance of each unit within a module:

- `mandatory` units define the **minimum course requirements**  
- `recommended` units should be **considered strongly**  
- Other resources support **internal differentiation** for learners seeking deeper or broader engagement
