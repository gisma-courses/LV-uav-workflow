## Welcome to Micro Remote Sensing 


The course Micro Remote Sensing - provides a complete introduction to the reproducible acquisition preprocessing and examplary analysis of high resolution imaging threat data based on open source software. 

## Who should take this course?

This course is designed for students at all levels who have a basic knowledge of the organization of their operating system and want to acquire a hands-on approach to the independent acquisition of high-resolution aerial imagery data.

## Didactic Concept

 The course is structured as a sequential but *not* necessarily linear sequence of [modules](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/modules) to be worked through, each lasting approximately 2-3 weeks. Each module has the following structure:


  * [Outcomes](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/outcomes) - what is the learning objective.
  * [Readings](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/readings) - all kind of ressources.
  * [Experiences](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/experiences) - exercises & tutorials to practically master the learning goals.
  * [Assessments](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/assessments) - self assessment to get an idea how you peform.
