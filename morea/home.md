## Welcome to Micro Remote Sensing 


The course Micro Remote Sensing - provides a complete introduction to the reproducible acquisition preprocessing and examplary analysis of high resolution imaging threat data based on open source software. 

## Who should take this course?

This course is designed for students at all levels who have a basic knowledge of the organization of their operating system and want to acquire a hands-on approach to the independent acquisition of high-resolution aerial imagery data.

## Didactic Concept

 The course is structured as a sequential but *not* necessarily linear sequence of [modules](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/modules) to be worked through, each lasting approximately two to 3 weeks. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Prerequisites](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/prerequisites) - Basic knowledge upon which the module is based.
  * [Learning outcomes](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/outcomes) - what is the learning objective.
  * [Readings & Resources](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/readings), background material.
  * [Experiences](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/experiences) - training and exercises to practically master the learning objectives.
  * [Assessments](/LV-Micro-Remote-Sensing/assessments) - exercises/study/exam performance.
