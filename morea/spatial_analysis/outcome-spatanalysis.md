The module is intended to provide an initial insight into the automated and evaluation of high-resolution orthoimages and the point clouds. Since this topic easily fills several courses, the possibilities of more complex evaluations with QGIS and comparable software will be presented. The module offers:

- A lightning introduction to and classification of Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA), Machine Learning (ML and Deep Learning (DL) in relation to the task of the course.
- a template example of an OBIA classification run with QGIS and Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)
- the optional implementation of DL and ML classifications with R
- A first classification and analysis of point clouds 
with the goal to develop at least in principle in this area
