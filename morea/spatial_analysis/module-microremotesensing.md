Image data of very high spatial resolution (e.g. UAV-based orthoimages), place very high demands on methods and processing. The established methods are: object-based image analysis (OBIA), machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) . DL is usually the most efficient but also the most complex. However, OBIA provides good results with comparatively simple application.
